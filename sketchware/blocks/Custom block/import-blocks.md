To import blocks in Sketchware Pro you need a block file generated by exporting the block.

For example, I am going to use [File.json](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BVXQmYPJ-kHlt70y4j4eZt7TpMlUOhnJ/view?usp=drivesdk) and trying to import block from this file to Sketchware Pro.

Step 1: Go to Sketchware Pro and click on 3 dots.
