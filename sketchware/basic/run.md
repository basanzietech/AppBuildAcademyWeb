It is finally time to test your app on your Android device. Sketchware Pro will do the job of converting the UI and blocks into working code and converting the code into a functional Android app.

## Compiling
Click the `Run` button on the bottom-right corner of the screen.  
Sketchware Pro will then start compiling and building your app!

Sit back and relax while Sketchware Pro does the work.  
Once the compilation is complete, give the permission to install third-party apps (that's your app) and click `Install`.

:::note

This UI may differ between mobile brands. However, it should be easy to understand. It should look similar to when you installed Sketchware Pro. This screenshot was taken from a Samsung device running One UI 6.1, Android 14.

You may see a Play Protect warning after clicking on `Install`. Click on `More Details` and then `Install anyway` or `Install without scanning`.

Now, click on `Open` or open your app from the home screen.

## Trying it out

Try clicking that neat button.
