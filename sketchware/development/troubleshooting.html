<h3>Best Practices for Mobile App Development</h3>

<p>In this section, we'll cover best practices for mobile app development, including design patterns, coding standards, and testing methodologies.</p>

<h3>Design Patterns</h3>

<ul>
    <li>MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern: Used to separate concerns and improve code organization</li>
    <li>MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern: Used to separate concerns and improve data binding</li>
</ul>
